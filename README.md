# Image-Segmentation-using-EM-algorithm

Image segmentation is a process to divide given input image into multiple segments
(different sets of pixels,also called superpixel or blob). In segmentation, we provide a
label to each and every pixel in the image using some pixelâ€™s attribute like its intensity,
neighbours, frequency etc. This technique can be used to locate objects in the picture,
draw boundaries, extracting meaningful interpretation etc and is being widely used in
medical imaging, self driving cars, satellite image mapping etc.
